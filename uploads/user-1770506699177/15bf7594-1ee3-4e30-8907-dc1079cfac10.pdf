Overview: Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources, which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.

Wind Power: Wind turbines use the wind's kinetic energy to generate electricity. They consist of large blades that turn a shaft connected to a generator. Wind farms can be located onshore or offshore.

Hydroelectricity: This process uses the flow of water (usually from a dam or river) to spin turbines. It is one of the oldest and most widely used forms of renewable energy.

Geothermal Energy: This involves tapping into the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. It can be used for direct heating or to produce steam that drives electricity-generating turbines.
